# Security Operations Center Bot

A Webex Teams Bot that integrates with the many APIs available across the Cisco Security portfolio to provide alerts and allow remediation with a ChatOps interface

## Business/Technical Challenge

Some of the biggest challenges faced by Security Operations Centers (SOCs) include an increasing volume of security alerts, the management of numerous security tools, and being able to quickly and effectively respond to threats once they are identified. With the snowballing number of security alerts being received, valuable analyst time is being consumed sorting through a plethora of security alerts. As a wider range of security suites are being adopted by SOCs and CSIRTs, it is becoming ever more difficult to effectively monitor all of the data being generated from the multiplying number of data points and sources.

## Proposed Solution

Our goal is to build a Webex Teams Bot that can help SOCs adapt to these challenges by providing them with a single place to view alerts and respond to threats quickly without leaving their chat tool. This will allow SOCs to quickly identify and remediate security risks from anywhere at any time.
